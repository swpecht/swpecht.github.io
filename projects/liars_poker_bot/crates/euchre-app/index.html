      Euchre is a card game where you and a partner try to take more tricks than the opponent team.
      The game is two phases. In the first, trump is decided. In the second, cards are played to take tricks
    </p>

    <p>
      For an overview of the rules, see Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchre"

    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="font-bold"> Optionally play with a friend </span><br>
      You can play with a friend against the ai bots by sharing the url after you create a game. If you play alone,
      you'll get an ai agent as a teammate.

      <span class="font-bold">Bots use counter factual regret minimization (CFR) and perfect information monte carlo
        tree
        search (PIMCT)</span><br>
      Using counter factual regret minimization (CFR) alone would result in a stronger bot.
      But CFR cannot be naively applied to euchre -- the game is too large.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, I use CFR for the first phase where trump is chosen and PIMCTS for the second phase where cards are
      played.
