## Context

For perfect information games, can use expectation maximization to build a bot

Supposedly you can't do that with imperfect information games.

Going to use Liar's poker bots to illustrate why.

## Results


Next steps -- need to switch the minimax agent to use the game tree implementation.
Easier to debug and inspect and can work on optimizations later
